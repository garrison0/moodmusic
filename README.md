A sizable personal website. 

Made with JavaScript, HTML5 (canvas) and CSS, in parts with React (about page) and Bootstrap (react-bootstrap for about page, bootstrap for project page).

Jekyll is used to create the 'nonsense' blog, customized from a template.

Running in front of the about page is a boids script where all the boids (n = 10000) simply try to keep space around themselves
and are attracted the mouse.

All the source code for the projects is in the 'projects' folder.

Re-organization and project descriptions to come.
